# web-development
In this repository I'll upload (by adding submodules) the different projects from Juan Pablo's course of Web Development.

> **Disclaimer:** I'm starting to learn how to use **Git/Github** correctly, therefore there'll be plenty of pull requests, commits and other stuff as tests in this repository, however, *this won't represent my way of working forever*, I'll learn more things along the way as always :D!.
